### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub page 👋
#### Name's Ethan, I'm a Technical & 3D Hardsurface Artist specializing in the creation Blender add-ons and pipeline tools.

I work mostly in 🐍 Python for personal projects and at work. A majority of my professional work is private but I'm happy to share code samples at request! You can view my regular artwork on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/razed).

To support me consider purchasing my blender add-ons on [Gumroad](https://razed.gumroad.com/) or [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/creators/ethan-simon-law) and maybe leave a review :)
