### Hi there, welcome 👋
#### Hey, name's Ethan. I'm a Tools Programmer & Hard Surface Artist specializing in the creation of production pipeline tools.

I frequently work in 🐍 Python for personal and work projects. A majority of my professional work is private, I'm more than happy to supply code samples at request! You can also view my 3D work on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/razed).

To support me consider getting my Blender add-ons on [Gumroad](https://razed.gumroad.com/) or even [Blender Market](https://blendermarket.com/creators/ethan-simon-law) and maybe leave a review :)

I also have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/razed) page if you'd like to send a tip!
